  title: "Human-driven design: how to know your users and build what they need"
  description: "How do you decide what to build? What does your process look like before you write a line of code? How do users’ needs, desires and skills inform how you imagine your solutions and refine your work along the way? Let’s kick around questions like this, and talk about ways to meet users’ needs on their own terms. I can start by sharing the process we used to make Census Reporter, where we researched, designed, reached out, cajoled, built, took criticism, reworked, and ultimately made a tool that serves up a complex data set with a simple interface. And then let's talk about *your* process. How do you plan what you’re going to build next?\n\nOutcome: People should leave this session with ideas about: the principles that help you engage in user-centered design, how a design process improves your project, how to craft a process that will work for them."
  name: Ryan Pitts
  activities: "- A short opening segment, walking through the design and decision process we engaged in for Census Reporter and noting the framework that worked for us and the principles we extracted from it\n\n- Break into small groups to talk through a few questions: Do you use a design process? What does it look like? What works, and what doesn't? What have you learned about users? The goal here is for people to be able to talk through specific examples of their work\n\n- Regroup and spend time in guided discussion, trying to extract principles that participants have identified from previous experience. Things that work, things worth trying, things to remember or watch out for."

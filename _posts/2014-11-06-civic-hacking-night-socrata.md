22 civic minded folks attended this typical Thursday night event with a mix of disciplines at various stages of mastery. 

Here’s a bit of what was going on… Help with creating a web presence for a volunteer service helping senior citizens in Illinois; work on the Duwamish River clean up; and lot of sharing, mentoring and learning code.

Part of the joy of civic engagement is sharing what we know through working on projects.
 
Do your part to increase civic engagement through technology and attend the next event!

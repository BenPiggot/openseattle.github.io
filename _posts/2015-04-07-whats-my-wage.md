In early February, Anna Minard of Working Washington came to a Code for Seattle meeting and brought the idea of a calculator to help workers determine their minimum age under the new law. Effective  April 1st, employers in Seattle must increase their employees' minimum wage over a four-year period until it reaches $15/hr..
However, employees across the city may see the phase-in of $15 at different scales depending on the size of their employer and what benefits the employer offers.

"We wanted workers to know which category they were in so they would know whether they were being paid the correct minimum wageâ€”and have an easy way to report it if they thought they weren't getting what they're owed," says Anna.

The project's biggest challenge would be to build something that both accurately interpreted the law and yet simple enough for anyone to access from their phone and quickly --such as on break.

As of April 1st, ![(http://whatsmywage.org)whatsmywage.org]is live. The back

## Code for Seattle is a "brigade" of Code for America

We are a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a>, which means we're a group of Seattleites that contribute our talents towards improving the way our local governments and community organizations use the web. 

Code for Seattle is about action and you're here because you are someone who takes action. <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/activities">See what kind of things brigades do</a>, or <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/03/08/jennifer-pahlka-at-ted-video/">watch this inspirational TED talk given by Jennifer Pahlka, the founder of Code for America.</a></p>

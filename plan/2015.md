## What we want to do in 2015

- Make it easy for everyone to participate
- Design for people's needs
- Make data easy to find and use
- Use data to make and improve decisions

### Strategy & Tactics
One of the trends we see in Seattle this fall that we expect to continue through 2015 is an
increasing willingness and interest on the part of government agencies to partner and run
hackathons for issues and problems we're facing. We saw the first of these in the SPD
hackathon on Police Video Recording in December, and the SPD has signalled interest in
continuing a series of such events through 2015.  Partnering with individual departments
to work on targeted issues appears to draw significant interest, and we see interest and
opportunity for code for seattle to be involved in these events.

We want to increase our outreach, which we see as critical for making it easy to
participate. Partially we hope to do this by attending, participating and promoting
civic data at other events. Specifically, we're interested in targetting events like
the Makers Faire in the summer, and course material to get civic data into the various
coding bootcamps offered around the city.

Finally, we want to formalize some of the process of the brigade, and will begin investigating
the possibility of creating a paid code for seattle organization and outreach position /
fellowship. There's a lot of administrative work around the brigade, and we believe
the organization could grow much faster with dedicated time spent responding to emails,
proactively reaching out to manage event logistics, and forging community partnership.

### Outcomes

- Increased event attendance
- Examples of popular projects affiliated with Code for Seattle

## What we want to do in 2015

- Make it easy for everyone to participate
- Design for people's needs
- Make data easy to find and use
- Use data to make and improve decisions


### Strategy & Tactics


#### Educational events & projects

**Focus more on speaker events, project pitch/demo nights, unconferences, & ongoing programs than hackathons**

Code for Seattle has successfully organized a number of one-day events, and in 2015 we'll be putting more effort toward ongoing events that happen over a period of weeks or months.


**Improve nwdata.org, a regional guide to open data**

The Pacific Northwest has a substantial amount of open data available, and nwdata.org acts as an outreach tool for introducing people to what open data exists, what apps have been built with that data, and what resources exist for learning about and building civic technology projects.


#### Project promotion & community building

One challenge Code for Seattle has struggled with is doing promotion of projects with the purpose of connecting volunteers and other resources with project leaders. We'll be revising the way our project list at codeforseattle.org/projects is maintained, including integrating the list with CFAPI & The Civic Tech Issue Tracker.

In addition, we'll start a series of posts on codeforseattle.org that profile project leaders and volunteers that help the community learn more about what projects people are working on and who is involved.

### Outcomes

- Increased event attendance
- Examples of popular projects affiliated with Code for Seattle
- New open Seattle datasets available
